        <h2>Technical Theatre Roles and Shows</h2>
        <p>During my time at university, I got involved in the world of technical theatre. During this time I worked on multiple different shows with <a href="https://www.warwicktechcrew.co.uk/" target="_blank">Warwick Tech Crew</a></p>
        <p>Here, I'd like to reflect on shows I worked on both during my time at university and afterwards.</p>
